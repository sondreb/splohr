# Update 2021

This project started with an idea to make a really basic and beautiful blockchain explorer. Eventually I instead did another explorer that is available here:

https://github.com/block-core/blockcore-explorer

It is a multi-chain block explorer and you can view it here in action:

https://explorer.blockcore.net/

That means this project likely won't be developed any further.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
